[Mapa Especial](https://mapaespecial.com) is an open-source directory of specialty coffee establishments in the SÃ£o Paulo metro area and the Baixada Santista. The project aims to help SÃ£o Paulo residents discover small businesses in the specialty coffee industry.

The map displays cafÃ©s and coffee shops that meet the following criteria:

1. The establishment uses single-origin, ethically sourced specialty coffee beans.
2. The establishment aims to offer a great sensory experience for drinkers of black coffee.
3. The establishment staff received the training necessary to brew specialty coffee in accordance with the roaster's tasting notes.
4. The establishment is independently run and is not part of a large chain.
5. The establishment identifies as a cafeteria or a coffee shop. Restaurants with a coffee menu do not qualify because they may lack quality control, as their primary goal is feeding customers.

The website's source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license. We welcome outside contributions to improve the website and its content.

## Disclaimer

* This is a hobby project. The creator is not affiliated with any of the establishments listed on the website.
* Website data comes from public sources and is not guaranteed to be correct. Feel free to correct any mistakes you encounter.
* An omission (or inclusion) of any business does not constitute a judgement on the quality of its coffee.
* There are good coffee places in bad neighbourhoods. Don't take unnecessary risks in SÃ£o Paulo.
* Nobody is guaranteed a good cup of coffee. Good baristas have bad days. Pressure and temperature influence coffee equipment. Good roasters have bad batches.

## Architecture and dependencies

* Mapa Especial is a static website built with **Next.js** and **React.js**.
* The website does not use a database. The data is stored in the **GeoJSON** format, which is easy to read and edit.
* The website uses the `leaflet` library to display map data.
* The interactive inputs in the filter component are powered by `headlessui` and `react-select`.
* The `react-hook-form` library manages the filter form.
* The website uses `mdx` files to generate pages without interactive content. MDX allows you to mix Markdown code with JSX code.
* The icons for map markers include the following third-party art from The Noun Project (CC BY 3.0):
    1. [Coffee](https://thenounproject.com/icon/coffee-5340097/) by *ohriandesign*
    2. [Coffee cup](https://thenounproject.com/icon/coffee-cup-3203806/) by *Adrien Coquet*
* The website's UI includes icons from the [Phosphor icon family](https://phosphoricons.com) (MIT license).

### Add or edit website data

Outside contributors can create pull requests to amend website data or remove incorrect website data. Fork the repository from your GitHub account, edit the files, and open a pull request.

* The `src/data/cafes.json` file stores cafÃ© data.
* The `src/data/shops.json` file stores shop data.
* The `src/data/roasters.json` file stores roaster data.

The `roasters.json` file stores the list of roasters. Roaster objects reference the IDs of cafes and shops that use the roaster's coffee:

```js
    {
        "name": "roasterName",
        "roasterID": 1, /*  has to be unique */
        "ownShops": [1], /*  IDs of shops that are owned by the roaster. Find shop IDs in the "shops.json" file */
        "ownCafes": [1], /*  IDs of cafes that are owned by the roaster. Find cafe IDs in the "cafes.json" file */
        "clientShops": [2], /*  IDs of third-party shops that sell the roaster's beans */
        "clientCafes": [2] /*  IDs of third-party cafes that use the roaster's beans */
    }
```
